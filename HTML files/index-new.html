    <p>Theta Mart allows customers to create an order on our website to have products 
        delivered to them by one of our drivers from our store in Las Vegas within a 
        20-mile radius. The Theta mart database records each order and tracks the status 
        from when the orderâ€™s placed to delivery. Theta Mart takes 3,000 orders per year 
        and has 5 drivers currently active. Customers can place Orders for Products that 
        will be delivered by Drivers.
