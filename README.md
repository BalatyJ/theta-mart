This is Joseph Balaty and Xizhu Wang's portfolio project for 
CS 340 Introduction to Databases at Oregon State University during Fall term of 2022.

As part of a term long project in CS 340 Introduction to Databases at Oregon State University, Xizhu Wang and I in a virtual setting built a web application in Python using a MySQL database backend. Our team received a 99.2% score on this challenging real world assignment. Specific accomplishments include:

Documented the data driven operational goals of tracking delivery orders for a retailer using narrative, ERD, and Schema models.

Incorporated feedback at five different stages to normalize the schema and refine the project, including data validation for NULL and negative numbers to ensure reliability and implemented ON DELETE SET NULL for orders when a corresponding Driver is deleted from the database.

Implemented backend code to perform SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE among five entities and INSERT/UPDATE for one intersection entity.

Developed DDL code to create the schema, with example data to illustrate table functionality; performed periodic BACKUPs. 

Wrote application code that implemented the UI front end in a third party hosted Linux environment. I was personally responsible for [summarize your contribution e.g. "writing the code to perform six out of twelve data driven operations, developing the DML and normalizing the database"].
coding the CRUD functionality for three of the six entities, including the basic UI, and QAing the final DDL and DMQ files.
