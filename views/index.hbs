<p>Theta Mart allows customers to create an order on our website to have products
    delivered to them by one of our drivers from our store in Las Vegas within a
    20-mile radius. The Theta mart database records each order and tracks the status
    from when the orderâ€™s placed to delivery. Theta Mart takes 3,000 orders per year
    and has 5 drivers currently active. Customers can place Orders for Products that
    will be delivered by Drivers.
